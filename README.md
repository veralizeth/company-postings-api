# NodeJS Backend Engineer Code Challenge

Use the included Database and mock API to create a basic microservice that exposes a simple REST API. For this exercise, the goal is to demonstrate your ability to write clean production quality code. Assume that this microservice will support a high volume of calls. You will be evaluated on how easy your code would be to maintain in an enterprise production setting.
